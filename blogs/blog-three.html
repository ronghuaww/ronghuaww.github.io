        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I was able to finish Project 1 a few days before it was due. This was 
        mainly motivated by the fact that Wednesday was completely booked for 
        me; I knew I was not able to touch the assignment that day. 
        Nevertheless, it was still something small that I am very proud of. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        At that moment, I used time management skills to ensure that my 
        assignments were done on time. Blocking out my time on my calendar, 
        I divided the available times for different tasks for this assignment 
        such as writing the body of the code, unit tests, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Being able to finish my assignments on time, I was able to keep my 
        commitments and spend time with my friends as planned. Maintaining a 
        good balance between friends and academics is something important to 
        me that I want to maintain. 
    </p>

            What did you think of Paper #3. Continuous Integration
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a very informative reading. One thing I enjoyed was the writing 
        style. It felt like listening to a conversation about continuous 
        integration, making the article not only easy to read but also engaging. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What did you think of assertions, unit tests, coverage, is_prime() 
            and argument passing? 
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Assertions were a coding statement that I previously knew about, but 
        had difficulty understanding the purpose and usage of assertions in the 
        code. This also applies to the concept of unit tests and coverage; the 
        opportunity to implement it in our first assignment helped me understand 
        how to use it in future programming projects beyond this class. 
        Argument passing was a difficult concept to wrap my head around during 
        the first lecture. After seeing so many examples in the second example, 
        I gain a better understanding of addresses and pointers.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I finally understood the difference between addresses and pointers. 
        Admittedly, I used to blindly add pointers and ampersands until it 
        worked. 
    </p>

        Consistently use “TODO” at the beginning of a comment when indicating a 
        part of code that needs to be revisited. That way, all the tasks needed 
        to be done can be found by searching for “TODO” in the search bar. Many
         IDE also highlights these comments that start with “TODO”, making them 
         easy to find in a given file.
