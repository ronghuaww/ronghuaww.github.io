        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I was able to finish exercise 9 and exercise 10 early! These were the first few exercises that I was able to finish a few minutes before the time was up. Especially how badly I performed on my past exercises, I am happy that I am getting the hang of it.

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before every exercise, Professor Downing reviews a few concepts in class. Realizing my biggest weakness in exercises was writing incorrect syntax, I paid extra attention to the syntax that Professor Downing provided and immediately wrote it down during the exercise.

        <b>
            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because I finished the exercise early, I helped out with some of my peers around me.

        <b>
            What did you think of Paper #12. Why extends is evil. 
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing that caught my eye was how the paper mentions passing iterators in the parameters rather than the objects themselves. This strongly helps with encapsulation and I see myself using this concept in future projects. 

    </p>

        <b>
            What did you think of Exercise #9. Shapes 1. 
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I was excited to try implementing the concept of inheritance. I had quite a bit of experience with inheritance through game development and was interested to see how it is implemented in C++. I also found the use of static_cast really interesting. 

    </p>


    <p>
        <b>
          What did you think of Exercise #10. Shapes 2.

        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        After seeing Professor Downing type out “virtual bool equals (const Shape& rhs) const”, I immediately told myself to remember that syntax is most likely going to be on the exercise. I am so glad I made a mental note about it; knowing that line really helped me set up and create momentum in completing the exercise in time. 

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What did you think of method overriding, virtual, and dynamic_cast? (This question will vary, week to week.)

        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Method overriding is something that I am familiar with due to my background in game development. Game engines like Unreal Engine 5 and Unity require programmers to build off of existing classes like CharacterBody3D to create new player objects. For virtual, I totally forgot it was something that existed; the lecture was a really good refresher for me. Furthermore, learning about dynamic_cast made me finally understand what static_cast entails.

            What made you happy this week?
        </b>

    <p>
     Saturday was so fun for me. My org had an event called Famlympics, where we competed against other fams; we won 3rd place! :D I also went shopping and had dinner with my friends afterward. It is so nice to take a break from programming and assignments.

        Career tips! One way to stand out and make meaningful connections with recruiters and other employees of a company is to take the conversations beyond the general questions about the application and recruiting process. Don’t forget they are people too! Imagine yourself in the place of a recruiter; what questions would spark your interest?
