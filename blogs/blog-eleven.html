        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For me, one small thing I am proud of myself is surviving this week: there were so many events and meetings I needed to attend, and balancing all that was not easy. 


    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        One skill that I used in addition to time management was the ability to remind myself to slow down. Sometimes, trying to do so many things at once is less productive than taking one task one at a task. It helps dedicating a section of time purely to focus on one particular task really helps. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This was more a personal event, and thus I don’t think it made any major impact on others. 
 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Paper #11. More on getters and setters.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I really like that there is multiple times that I can exposed to the concept of why getters and setters can be bad. Seeing it multiple times really helps me understand the concept with every read. 

    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of the ethics lectures? (This question will vary, week to week.)
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I had fun! The way the lectures presented multiple hypothetical scenarios was really engaging to think about. There was many scenarios that was mentioned that I have not really thought about thoroughly. Especially with the real life connections, it made me really mindful about my actions and my future impact as a programmer. 

    </p>

        <b>
            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I had two performances this week and it was been a blast dancing alongside my friends. It is really beauiful to see our hardwork come to life.

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes, for projects with time ​​constraints, let yourself give up on a particular implementation design. For my game technology class, we spent way too many hours trying to get Godot’s new libraries Multiplayer Synchronizer and Multiplayer Spawner work in our implementation just to discover that it cannot support our design at all.
