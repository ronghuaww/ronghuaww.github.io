        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I found a partner for project 2! Since my experience of working on 
        Computer Graphics projects alone, I have learned that you may learn 
        less from working alone than working by yourself.

            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I think getting over the fear of reach out and ask others if they are 
        interested in partnering up is the biggest step.

            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Not sure what impact I have on other people in that moment, but 
        hopefully us partnering up, we can be more successful in 
        completing the project.

            What did you think of Paper #4. Pair Programming
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was an interesting read. In my past computer science classes, we read 
        the same article regarding pair programming, so it was interesting to 
        read an unfamiliar document that presented a different perspective on 
        this topic.

            What did you think of Project #1. Grades
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a fun project! Even though there were so many little separate 
        requirements, making test cases, issues on GitLab, etc, these 
        requirements made me practice these styles and exposed me to these 
        concepts that I never explored before.

            What did you think of exceptions, strcmp(), vector, list and deque? 
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing I learned about exceptions that caught my attention was that 
        it's possible to have inheritance with exceptions. For strcmp(), it was 
        really fun implementing it in class, and it was mind blowing to see how 
        simple the solution actually was when written in class. For vectors, 
        for the longest time, I always treat vectors like array, without fully 
        understanding it. It seems like I was pretty close. For lists, my 
        assumptions was that they were also like arrays, because I made the 
        connection Python and its List. I learned that I was very incorrect. 
        For deque, my first thought was stacks or a queue, but turns out they 
        are similar to a symmetric nested array.

            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I have enough 3s to replace one of my 1s! I’m so bad at quizzes so this 
        a big win for me.

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Don’t be afraid to use libraries! Often times the ideas I have has been 
        already created by someone else and published in the world wide web.
