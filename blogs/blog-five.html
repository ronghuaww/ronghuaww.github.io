        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m getting better at the daily quizzes! Got a few 3s more than before. 

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I don’t think I am using any major skills for these moments; I think 
        I am finally getting used to the class structure. 

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I am able to provide more help to friends around me during these quizzes.

            What did you think of Paper #5. Single Responsibility Principle.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s a fun read; reminds me of multiple concepts I learned in my game 
        development classes. For instance, in games, it is very important to 
        organize your classes relating to game objects, like players, items, 
        etc, so that functions do not collide with one another. 
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of consts, arrays, algorithms and iterators? 
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Const is such a fun concept, I never knew there were so many different 
        versions and placements of the word const for a given variable. When 
        Professor Downing wrote “const int* const”, I was in shocked and amazed 
        that it was possible to write in C++. For iterators as well, it was so 
        cool learning that there is different versions of iterators like 
        bi-directional and random-access. For arrays, the lesson in class 
        reminded me of my computer architecture and operating systems class. 
        More specifically, how adding to an array variable incriminates the next 
        item because it adds the respective byte amounts to the address.

            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unrelated to this class, I got to participate in the Game Jam this year! 
        I was so scared I wasn’t able to make time for it like the previous two 
        years due to assignments, but this time, I was able to organize my time 
        better than before.

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        When working in a big team, and code is written in a repository, I 
        recommend integrating GitHub webhooks into one of the Discord channels. 
        Having a notification system of all the changes made is so helpful in 
        keeping track of changes by multiple people.
