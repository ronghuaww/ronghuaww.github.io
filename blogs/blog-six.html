        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I got project two done! Even though it was submitted a day late, it was 
        a really happy moment when my partner and I finished debugging all the 
        errors. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Definitely peer programming and communication. Going through each line 
        of code one at a time, and reading the print statements to see if it 
        matches with the intended output was so helpful. There were multiple 
        instances where we caught bugs that the other programmer did not realize. 
    </p>

            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I think working with my partner, we both got to learn a lot more about 
        pointers and design implementations. It was so helpful to be able to 
        talk it out with another person.

            What did you think of Paper #6. Open-Closed Principle.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a fun read! Its really nice to read more extensively about the 
        OOP concepts I have learned before. More specifically, it was really 
        eye-opening to see how they used virtual classes for the open-closed 
        principle. 
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Project #2. Voting.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a fun project! Even though there was a lot of debugging, it was 
        really fun practicing my skills using pointers and references. I also 
        got the chance to practice using different data structures like vectors, 
        lists, and arrays throughout this project which gave me more confidence 
        in using these various data types. 
    </p>
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of reverse(), iterator_tags, const methods and 
            friend functions? (This question will vary, week to week.)
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        reverse() is such an easy concept, but implementation-wise, it was 
        harder than I expected. Const is also a fun concept to learn, I 
        definitely plan on using it more as it is so helpful to restrict 
        changes made to a variable that you don’t want to change. It was 
        interesting to learn about all the different types of iterators, I 
        didn’t know there was so many types and how different data structures 
        are connected with specific types. For friends functions, my friend 
        had told me about their use before but I had a difficult time wrapping 
        my head around it. After seeing it in class, it finally clicked!

            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unrelated to this class, but I had a really fun time at the Mid Autumn 
        Festival on Friday. It was so amazing to see all the student 
        performances and have the chance to dance with my friends on stage.

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Write clear and clean debugging print statements! It’s fun for a few 
        print statements to have silly strings like “here” or emojis, but 
        once there are more 3 print lines, it can get very confusing. Thanks 
        to my partner and their amazing print statements, we were able to debug 
        our code in a speedy manner.
