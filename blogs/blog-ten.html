        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I found partners for projects 4 and 5 :D As an introvert, bringing up 
        the conversation and asking others to partner up was a bit difficult. 
        After cramping Project 3 all into one day, I wanted to work with another 
        student to motivate me to start early. 

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Communication skills play a big part; I think getting over the fear of 
        asking to partner is the biggest challenge. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Not sure what impact I have on other people at that moment, but 
        hopefully us partnering up, we can be more successful in completing 
        the project.  
    </p>

            What did you think of Paper #10. Why getter and setter methods are evil.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I really like this quote “Don’t ask for the information you need to do 
        the work; ask the object to do the work for you”. This sentence helps me 
        conceptualize and understand what we can do instead of getters and setters. 
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Exercise #7. Vector2.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I got to finish this exercise. Though I don’t remember much from it; the 
        panic of trying to finish it in time was the only thing I remembered. 
    </p>
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Exercise #8. Vector3.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I was not able to finish this exercise. Like previous unfinished 
        exercises, I had such difficult time getting my first line of code to 
        compile. Once I was able to compile it, it was so much easier to 
        complete, but sadly I didn’t have enough time to write all the code out 
        by then. 
    </p>
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of move constructor, and move assignment? 
            (This question will vary, week to week.)

        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was mind-blowing when Professor Downing suggested taking advantage 
        of the fact that the local variable was going to die. I never considered it before. 
 
    </p>

            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unrelated to programming, but something that made me happy was seeing 
        the progress of my dance team. With each practice, it is so cool to see 
        it all come together; it is so beautiful to see the forms getting 
        cleaner and the moves more in sync. Practice does make perfect :D 

    </p>

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Take breaks and use that extra slip day. For my game tech class, my team 
        and I struggled to combine our code which led to a big pile of compile 
        errors and bugs that we had never seen before. We feared that the bugs 
        were never going to be resolved, but the next day, seeing the code again, 
        much of our issues were resolved.
