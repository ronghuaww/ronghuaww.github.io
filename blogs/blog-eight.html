        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        After being unable to finish exercise #4 arrays, I felt proud to be able 
        to finish exercise #5, digits. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Alots of collaboration skills with the peers around me. Discussing the 
        bugs and implementation design with each other made the impossible feel 
        possible. At the same time, we learned to implement one item at a time; 
        in our previous attempt, we tried to implement all parts at the same 
        time. By going through each test case and implementing the required 
        methods first was really helpful. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our communication and collaboration helped all of us complete the 
        exercise on time; we felt less stressful than previous attempt.

            What did you think of Paper #8. Interface Segregation Principle.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        To me, it was a difficult read that required me to reread multiple 
        sections several times. 
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Exercise #5. Digits.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I felt more prepared for this exercise than the previous one, exercise 
        4, arrays. After seeing templates so many times—I appreciate Professor 
        Downing reviewing the same concepts over and over again, I felt more 
        comfortable writing constructors and operators. Also, the opportunity to 
        redo our poor attempts was so helpful and a very good learning 
        experience. From our first attempt, we got stuck at implementing to the 
        next item because, in our first design, the iterator only had one item 
        in the list; we only constructed the iterator with the first item. 
        Learning from our first attempt, we realized that in order for the 
        iterator to go to the next object, it needs the whole list, and 
        therefore the whole list can be passed to the iterator constructor. 
    </p>
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of queue<T, C>, priority_queue<T, C>, and 
            vector<T, C>? (This question will vary, week to week.)

        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        After learning that data structure can have various backing containers, 
        it was fun learning about queue, priority_queue, and vector, as they 
        can have backing containers that does not work for their implementation. 
        Because we were introduced to many data structures and its possible 
        backing containers, I definitely need to revisit and have practice 
        with them before I can comfortably understand them.

            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m slowly getting back into the pacing of my school assignments and my 
        commitments! It was a difficult week, trying to catch up with all the 
        school work I missed last week due to the Grace Hopper Celebration 
        Conference. I lost quite a bit hours of sleep, but at the end, it all 
        worked out :D 
    </p>

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Focus your attention on code design over implementation! I am currently 
        taking Game Tech, and we were given the task of designing an AI Agent 
        system, in our case, a state machine from scratch. Implementation time 
        took significantly less amount of time than I expected because we were 
        able to design it ahead of time.
