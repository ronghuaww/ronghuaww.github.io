        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        One small thing that I was proud of was starting my assignments early. 
        The projects in this class require many tools I have not been exposed to 
        like Docker and checktestdata. At first, it felt daunting trying to 
        understand each tool and its purpose, but as I spent more time reading 
        each provided file in the repository, I slowly felt more confident in 
        completing this assignment. The Perusall reading this week about the 
        project’s Makefile was such a big help. 
    </p>

            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In that moment, I had to overcome the feeling of not knowing. I think 
        not knowing how to start is a big roadblock that prevents me from 
        starting an assignment early. Being unafraid and reading through each 
        available resources one bit at a time was very helpful. 
    </p>

            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I don’t think this moment had a major impact on other people. Maybe 
        someone reading my experience helps bring comfort to those who 
        experience something similar.

            What did you think of Paper #1. Syllabus?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I think it is important to have a reading assignment regarding the class 
        syllabus, ensuring that everyone has read through it. Every class varies 
        in grading and assignment policies and reading through it helps make 
        sure that students know the expectations and policies for this class. 
        I also enjoy reading through students’ comments on different parts of 
        the syllabus. It was eye-opening to learn their perspectives and 
        opinions regarding class grading policies.

            What did you think of Docker and operator overloading? (This 
            question will vary, week to week.)
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This class was my first exposure to Docker and after learning about 
        them in class, I find this tool really useful. When I didn’t have 
        success in downloading the tools to my local computer or SSH into 
        the lab machines, Docker worked for me to run and complete my 
        assignments. As for the topic of operator overloading, it was 
        fascinating to learn about its limitations. There are so many 
        C++-specific operations that I am excited to use one day. 
    </p>

        <b>
            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I was quite happy when Docker worked on my computer. (I normally don’t 
        have a good history of things working in my favor when it comes to 
        using new tools). 
    </p>

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Read the makefiles! A lot of the tasks that I thought I had to do by 
        hand could be easily generated with a command in the Makefiles.
