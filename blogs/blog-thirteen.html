        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Relating to this class, I canâ€™t think of anything I was proud of doing 
        last week. Beyond this class, I was quite proud of myself for making 15 
        rolls of Kimbap in 4 hours; I was surprised I was able to make so many 
        rolls. 
    </p>

            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?

        Time management and making many educated guesses. I had to block out 
        time for everything I needed to do that day: hosting office hours, 
        walking home, buying more carrots, etc. I also needed to make an 
        estimation of how much food I needed, how much spinach to cook, etc.

        I was able to feed so many friends at various Friendsgivings!

        I was quite happy when I realized what the article's content was about; 
        such topics are talked about only sometimes in computer science. I am 
        lucky to have not experienced such discrimination as mentioned in the 
        article, but I have felt a bit discouraged in male-majority groups or 
        courses. Seeing articles like these, where women voice their experiences, 
        really helps me feel that I am less alone in all of this.

            What did you think of the virtual method overriding and Life? 
            (This question will vary, week to week.)

        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I have heard about virtual in the past but never really knew what it
        meant; I really like C++ and its requirements for being specific when 
        wanting a class-specific implementation. For Life, after seeing the 
        project breakdown, I am both excited and quite nervous: excited in 
        that I get to take what I learned about object-oriented to the next 
        level, but nervous because I have no idea where to start.

        The cold winter! I am so happy to be wearing my sweater and staying warm 
        under layers of blankets. I also had so much fun spending time with my 
        friends during Friendsgiving; there was so much food :D.

        Miro boards and Whiteboard on Discord have been such helpful tools when 
        building a design in team-based projects. While I often use Disord Voice 
        Call to communicate with my team members remotely, Whiteboard is an app 
        that is integrated into Discord where all members can draw, type, and 
        add sticky notes during the call in live time. A similar setup exists 
        in Miro boards, but users can get on and modify the board at any time.
