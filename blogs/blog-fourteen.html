        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For the topic of extensive testing, in my experience, every programming 
        project has enforced this takeaway. Regardless of what I am building, I 
        have always broken the problem into parts and tested along the way. 
        Having multiple programming projects in this class helped reinforce such 
        ideas. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For understanding when to use certain weakest or strongest iterators, I 
        don’t think I have used iterators too frequently during the course of 
        this class. Would like to have more practice with them. My understanding 
        for building adapters on top of containers and iterators is not the 
        strongest and would like to have more practice with them in class as well. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For the concept of not using new and delete, I liked how we were told 
        multiple different implementations instead of using new and delete. For 
        the concept of always looking for reuse and symmetry in your code, the 
        last project, Life, helps in solidifying this concept. The exercises in 
        class, like shapes, also really helped. 
    </p>

    <p>
        As for collaboration, I liked how there are multiple opportunities for 
        collaboration. Especially for the projects, it is nice to be able to 
        talk through design ideas with another student. Lastly, to make your 
        code beautiful, I liked how we learned about astyle and were forced to 
        use it in our code. I never considered that there were tools that did 
        this for us. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Were there any other particular takeaways for you?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Operator overloading! Being able to compare and modify user-defined 
        classes through such overloading was such a cool concept when first 
        learned about.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I have grown a love for Docker and makefiles! It makes running commands 
        significantly easier. Will definitely be using them in the future.   
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            In the end, how much did you learn relative to other UT CS classes?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of learning about a particular programming language—in this 
        case, C++ — I have learned significantly more relative to other UT 
        computer science classes. In terms of concepts and learning about 
        good practices, it is the equivalent in comparison. 
    </p>
        <b>
            There are many other aspects to this class, and I would like your 
            feedback on them. Please pick at least 5 of the following that you 
            feel passionate about, tell me whether you loved or hated them, and 
            give me any suggestions for improving them. 
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Cold Calling: </b> I was not a fan of them at first but have grown a more 
        liking for them. Viewing it from a teaching standpoint, it does make 
        sense in making sure students are paying attention and help address 
        any confusion they may have. 


    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Collaborative Quizzes on Canvas: </b> I really like them, in the 
        sense that it gives students the opportunity to discuss and work 
        through the problem together. However, due to the given amount of time, 
        much discussion was cut short; thus, it would be nice to have more 
        time on them. 

    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Collaborative Exercises on Ed Lessons: </b> Same as the 
        collaborative quizzes on Canvas, I really like the opportunity 
        to be able to discuss project designs with my peers.

    </p>
    <p> <b> Weekly Blogs: </b>  I really look forward to them and reading other 
        people’s blogs; it helps me learn more about the students in my class. 
        It also really helps with imposter syndrome in that I are not alone 
        in the stress and doubt that I feel. 

    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Ethics Lectures: </b> A really refreshing lecture; I appreciate the 
        reminder of the importance and the responsibility we have as a 
        programmer. Among the chaos of trying to make deadlines, it is a 
        reminder of the risks of wanting to find shortcuts.
