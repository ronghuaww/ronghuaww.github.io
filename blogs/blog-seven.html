        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I was absent most of this week, so something I was proud of last week 
        relates to my trip to the Grace Hopper Celebration. I am proud of myself 
        for getting out of my comfort zone speaking with so many people in the 
        industry and meeting so many software engineer students around the 
        country. 

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Communication skill is the most important skill at that moment. Not only 
        having an elevator pitch but also having the ability to have memorable 
        conversations with other women in the tech industry. 

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I got to create so many new and authentic relationships with so many 
        amazing people around the world. From our conversations, we got to 
        learn so much from each other. 

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Paper #7. Liskov Substitution Principle.        
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a fun read; it was fun seeing some overlaps from the previous 
        paper. 

    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Exercise #4. Array.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For me, it was such a difficult exercise. The main bottleneck was 
        knowing the syntax; because of this, I had a very difficult time 
        compiling just the constructor. Once the constructor was written and 
        compiled, I did not have enough time to complete the remainder of the 
        code. I was also unsure if I was supposed to use friends in the exercise. 
    </p>
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of stack<T, C>? (This question will vary, 
            week to week.)
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was really helpful reviewing this concept; I have not used stacks in 
        such a long time and this lecture was a good review for me. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unrelated to computer science, I passed my audition to dance at 
        Evenground next month. Dancing is my favorite extracurricular activity 
        and it helps me step away from my code, especially during the debugging 
        phase.

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Attend job fairs, especially ones like Grace Hopper Celebration, with a 
        mindset to network and learn from people around the world, rather than 
        having a goal of getting a job. Especially with employees from the 
        companies, conversations were more engaging and enjoyable when asking 
        questions beyond the internship process and resume reviews.
