        Hello everyone!     
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What are you most proud of doing last week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I got Project 3 Allocator completed! Even though it was turned in late, 
        I am still very proud of myself for finishing it. However, working on it 
        independently made me miss working in a team. 

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            What ability or skill did you use to make that moment the most proud 
            of?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I think something that really helped me complete the assignment was my 
        problem solving skills. More specifically, drawing out the designs on 
        paper first, and figuring out all the maths first before implementing 
        the code. 

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What impact did what you do have on other people?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        As I completed this assignment independently, I don’t think I had much 
        impact on other people. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Paper #9. The Dependency Inversion Principle.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a fun read! I love the way the text is written in a way as if I 
        was speaking with the author. It feels like a conversation, as he 
        introduce the overall issues and providing reasonings to these issues 
        with code examples. 
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of Exercise #6. Vector.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the array’s exercise, I definitely felt like I had a better 
        understanding of how to start and implement the exercise. However, I 
        would love to have more time given that I wasn’t able to complete the 
        exerise in time. 
    </p>
    </p>
        <b>
            What did you think of copy constructor, and copy assignment? (This 
            question will vary, week to week.)
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        My understanding of copy constructor and copy assignment has been 
        significantly improved this week. I love the fact that Professor 
        Downing keeps asking and repeating the concepts in every lecture. 
        It definitely helped me fully understand the usage of these two methods. 
        As a person who learns by seeing concepts over and over again, 
        having them marinate in my mind really helps me recall such information.   
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            What made you happy this week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I got my first interview for this semester! I had the biggest relief 
        after hearing that it is not a technical whiteboard interview. 

    </p>

            What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Build your program in increments! Build small parts of it and test that 
        it is working before adding more implementation on top of it. Never 
        write out the whole program and debug it from there. For me, building 
        my solutions this way really helped reduce my debugging time :D
