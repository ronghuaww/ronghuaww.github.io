    <p>
        Hello everyone!         
    </p>
    <p>
        (I’m using Github.io because one of my close friends used it for his blogs 
        and I thought it was pretty cool :D) 
    </p>
    <p>
        My name is Ronghua, I’m excited to meet everyone and your blogs :)
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m from McAllen, TX, a city in the Rio Grande Valley. I attended Lamar 
        Academy under the International Baccalaureate program and my favorite 
        extracurriculars were fine arts (painting, sculpting, printmaking, etc) 
        and tech theater (helping with props, costumes, etc). 
    </p>

        I came to UT because of its resources available to students. I have
        always been interested in both the arts and STEM, and this university 
        provides me the opportunity to have an education in both fields 
        simultaneously (I can double major in computer science, and arts 
        and entertainment technologies) (AET has some really cool game development 
        classes, I recommend checking them out :D ). 
    </p>
    <p>
        From what I remember, my high school physics teacher introduced me to 
        programming (shout out to Mr. Braden). Even though we coded directly 
        from the GitHub website, clicking on “edit this file” and “commit changes”, 
        it was so magical to me to see the page updates with new changes. It was 
        this experience that made me want to major in computer science.

        I am in this class because I want to learn C++; I have minimal knowledge 
        of C++ at the moment. With a passion for game development and animation, 
        I want to improve my understanding of objects and how to manage them in 
        an organized manner. I often use Unreal Engine 5 for my personal projects. 
        With C++ as its framework, I want to use what I learn in this class to 
        develop more robust works in this game engine. 
    </p>

        As a person with social anxiety, at first, I was not a fan of cold 
        calling. However, after attending the first few lectures, it became 
        less scary for me. The conversations that Prof. Downing has with each 
        student make the class more welcoming. It provides a safe space for 
        students to make mistakes and be honest about not understanding a certain 
        concept. Likewise with the specifications grading. At first, I feared that 
        quizzes would destroy my grades, but upon learning of the policy of making 
        up lower grades with higher grades, I am very hopeful for this class.

        Something that made me happy this week was my dance practices. I am in a 
        hip-hop dance organization called Entropy and we have been learning and 
        practicing the coolest choreography I have ever seen. Shout out to Henry 
        for his talent as he developed some amazing original choreography and 
        the kindest dance lead ever.

        Happy first week of last week of school everyone! :D
